# TODO:

- Function to create a single random individual, with setup for future usage of greedy algorithm instead of random
- Evaluation function w/ two dimensional fitness (summarical cost and count of columns), with future setup to allow Euclidean distance to be used as simple combination of dimensions
- Function to generate initial population. Random at first but with setup to choose between greedy and random or both with % ratio.
- Selection functions
- Decide on how we define neighbouring solution
- Mutations and Crossovers
- Allow choice of elitism
- Function to set up next generation
- Simple visualisations(graphs etc.) ofc. matplotlib (with future setup for realtime)
- Greedy algorithm
- TBC
